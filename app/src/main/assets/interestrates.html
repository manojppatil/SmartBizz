            <p class="white">A student should never compromise on the quality of his education because of financial constraints. He can seek financial assistance from banks by taking an educational loan.

We strive to&nbsp;provide education loans for skill-based training according to the requirements of the student.</p>

            <header><h5 class="footer-headings" >What is a student loan?</h5></header>
            <p class="white">A&nbsp;student&nbsp;loan also known as&nbsp;Student Education Loan, is the money lent by&nbsp;banks or other NBFCs&nbsp;to students so that they can pay for&nbsp;their&nbsp;educational fees&nbsp;</p>
